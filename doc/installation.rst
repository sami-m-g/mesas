Installation
============

The current version of mesas.py can be installed using Conda with::

    conda install -c conda-forge mesas

This will install any additional dependencies at the same time.

Alternatively, the code can be obtained from GitHub: https://github.com/charman2/mesas. Note that a fortran compiler is required to build from source (but is not required to install through Conda).

Clone the git repo and open a command prompt in the mesas directory (where the setup.py file sits). Make and install with::

    python setup.py install
