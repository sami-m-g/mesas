          INSTALLATION SUGGESTIONS FOR THE LIBRARY cdflib90


The  Fortran 95  source for  this  library is  found in  the files  in
directory  'SOURCE' that  have  the suffix  .f90.   Fortran 95  places
constraints on  the order in  which routines are compiled  (Fortran 77
did not).

We have provided two files to assist with compilation.

Makefile:  A make file that may be useful if your system has a 'make'
utility available.

compile.cdflib90: Compilation directives as a Unix shell script.

Both files make assumptions about your machine.

(1) The  name  of  the  Fortran  95  compiler is  f95.   This  is  not
    necessarily the case.  CVF  Fortran's compiler is called f90.  Use
    a text editor to modify this as needed.

(2) The  appropriate  flags to  the  compiler  are  '-c -O'.   On  our
    machine, DEC/Compaq/Intel  Alpha running True64 Unix,  and on most
    other  Unix machines,  -c means  produce  *.o files  and -O  means
    optimize for  speed.  You may need  to adjust these  flags to suit
    your compiler.

My   compiler    gives   the   following    warning   when   compiling
zero_finder.f90:

f90: Warning: zero_finder.f90, line 1001: Variable X is used before its value has been defined
        local%step_xsave = x
---------------------------^

The warning is spurious (but was worth checking out).

Once you have successfully compiled  all of the .f90 files, you should
have a .o file for each .f90 file.  Probably, you want to place the .o
in a library  for use by other programs.  How you  do this will depend
on your particular system.

On most Unices, the command
                       ar cr  libcdflib90.a *.o
will create a  library named 'libcdflib90.a' containing all  of the .o
files.   This library  should be  placed  where users  can access  it.
perhaps in  /usr/lib (although a system administrator  may be required
to install files in this directory).  The strange name for the library
was chosen so that the usual Unix linkage convention of the arguments
                        -lcdflib90 -L/usr/lib
can be used in linking the library into an object file.

Implementors should  consult local  documentation to determine  how to
create libraries (and perhaps where to place them).

          ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once you have successfully compiled  all of the .f90 files, you should
have a  module information file for  each .f90 file.  The  name of the
module  information file  differs by  system (even  within  flavors of
Unix).  Our  system calls them '.mod',  but at least  one other system
calls them '.module' and there may  easily be other names that I don't
know.

These files contain  information that the COMPILER of  a program using
one or  more cdflib90 routines needs  to know in order  to compile the
using program.  This information includes the calling sequence of each
routine in a module and more.

The .mod files should be moved or copied to a directory where they are
generally  accessible,  perhaps  /usr/mod/cdflib90.  On  our  machine,
these files are made accessible by using the f95 flag:
                         -I/usr/mod/cdflib90

Again, consult your local documentation or system administrator.

Good luck.
